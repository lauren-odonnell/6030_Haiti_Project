# Disaster_Relief_Project
Haiti Disaster Relief Project

This project was started as a class requirement for my master's. The goal was to utilize several statistical learning methods to evaluate the optimal algorithm for predicting whether or not a pixel contains a blue tarp from RGB data. Data was provided by the professor initially as one file for part one to train, then eight additional .csv files were provided as a holdout set for testing algorithm performance with the holdout set.

This project that started with a simple learning objective can used including actual disaster relief scenarios to dispatch aid or expanded for further image-recognition machine learning techniques. It was a method for me to test my data analytic skills in practice, how to work through challenges and discover helpful resources, understand efficiency in code, and understand different classification methods. 

R was the language utilized to conduct this study and R Studio was the IDE of choice.

Contained within this repo are the data files used, image examples, the .Rmd file containg the project, and a .html of the final project. To view the final knitted report, you can navigate to https://lauren-odonnell.github.io/
